-->In our project, we demostrate how to crack a hashed password(lebanese phone number password) using brute force method

    The first approach was the sequential method using for loops across all the prefixes
    The second appraoch was fork and join method
    The third approach was executer service method(POOL)

-->At the end, we compare each of the methods and we end up conluding that the POOL was the fastest one, then the fork and join then the sequential(which was expected)

    A report is also an output of the application with the name of "CrackReport.pdf". This pdf contains a table that compares each of the technologies used before

-->The report of the project is by the name of "ParalledCracker_Report".

-->This project was delivered to DR. Mohammad Aoudi
